# 3D-modelling-of-computer-lab
Our project title is 3D Computer Lab. OpenGL is a powerful graphics library that allows
developers to create stunning 3D visualizations in real-time.
One of the most exciting applications of OpenGL is in the creation of virtual environments, such as
computer labs. With the ability to create 3D models of objects, apply textures and materials, and set
up lighting and camera angles, it is possible to create a realistic and immersive experience for users.
In this project, we will explore the process of designing a 3D computer lab using OpenGL. This will
involve creating 3D models of the lab equipment which includes a Monitor ,CPU,Keyboard , Mouse,
Cables and a 3D Room, Blackboard, Furniture like Chairs, Tables, Door, Windows, Fans and setting
up lighting and textures, and implementing OpenGL code to create the virtual environment.
For the model of the lab, we took our campus computer lab as one of the references to make our
design.
By the end of this project, we will have a better understanding of the capabilities of OpenGL and how
it can be used to create realistic and interactive virtual environments
